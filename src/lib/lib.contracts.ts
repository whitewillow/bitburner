/**
 * Shortest Path in a Grid
 * You are attempting to solve a Coding Contract.
 * You have 10 tries remaining, after which the contract will self-destruct.
 *
 *
 * You are located in the top-left corner of the following grid:
 *
 *   [[0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0],
 *    [0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1],
 *    [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0],
 *    [1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0],
 *    [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0],
 *    [1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]]
 *
 * Answar: 'RDDRRRRRDDDRRR'
 *
 * You are trying to find the shortest path to the bottom-right corner of the grid,
 * but there are obstacles on the grid that you cannot move onto. These obstacles
 * are denoted by '1', while empty spaces are denoted by 0.
 *
 * Determine the shortest path from start to finish, if one exists.
 * The answer should be given as a string of UDLR characters,
 * indicating the moves along the path
 *
 * NOTE: If there are multiple equally short paths, any of them is accepted as answer.
 * If there is no path, the answer should be an empty string.
 *
 * NOTE: The data returned for this contract is an 2D array of numbers
 * representing the grid.
 *
 * Examples:
 *
 *     [[0,1,0,0,0],
 *      [0,0,0,1,0]]
 *
 * Answer: 'DRRURRD'
 *
 *     [[0,1],
 *      [1,0]]
 *
 * Answer: ''
 *
 *
 * If your solution is an empty string, you must leave the text box empty.
 * Do not use "", '', or ``.
